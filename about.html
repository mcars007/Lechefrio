## About

Hi, my name is Matthew and I'm currently a 20 year old college student studying Information Technology over at Florida International University. I'll be using this site as sort of a small portfolio for my technical works, but also as a hub in order for others to get a view of my interests. This site will be updated semi-weekly in order to maintain a consistent timeline of my work.

Expect lots of programs, random art, dance photos/videos, and most importantly, ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃｓ　ーナ茨.
